This microservice will be responsible for consolidating the list of current supervisors as well as updating the notification service. As a part of this coding challenge, any submissions to this module will simply display the results. This data does not need to be moved to another service.
1. This service must be implemented as a REST microservice with the following endpoints
a. GET /api/supervisors
i. This should return a JSON array of all the supervisors. The supervisors can be dynamically loaded via the REST endpoint at https://o3m5qixdng.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/api/managers
ii. The format of the supervisors returned must be displayed in the following format: “<jurisdiction> - <lastName>, <firstName>”
iii. The supervisors must be sorted in alphabetical order, first by jurisdiction, then my last name, finally by first name.
iv. Numeric jurisdictions should be removed from the response.
b. POST /api/submit
i. This endpoint should accept a request for a new notification request for a supervisor. The following data is required in the payload
1. firstName
2. lastName
3. email
4. phoneNumber 5. Supervisor
ii. If this is a successful request, then all the associated information should be printed to the console.
